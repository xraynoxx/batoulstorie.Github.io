                    average family that was not ready to raise a child, so she evaded her under the pretext of work (or not).

            This morning, Lottie wakes up in the taxi,
             heading to her new workplace, 
             and when she arrives, she notices the palace is large and beautiful<br>
             <br>
             <strong>Lottie:</strong> Uh-huh.... I wish it was my house... huh
             cheer up I'll live there if you accept so it's no different<br>
             <br>
             When she arrived, Flora's mother greeted her<br>
             <br>
             <strong>Flora mother:</strong> There you are, you're welcome<br>
             <br>
             Lottie seemed to me a very nice and beautiful woman who wished to be her friend<br>
             <br>
             <strong>Ooty:</strong> I was fascinated by your palace. It is beautiful and wonderful.
              It is strange not to mention it (you mean in the media sites).<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Flora mother:</strong> You are right. We made sure that this did not happen for the sake of our daughter, 
              so that she could live a normal childhood like any other girl.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Lottie:</strong> I see<br>
              <br>
              Laura's mother gave her a small brochure and guided her around the palace. 
              She was surprised that the palace was empty and looked lonely to her, 
              let alone a child (you mean Flora).<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Flora mother:</strong> You may notice that there are no people here.
               You are right that you will know them when their work begins anyway.
               I just gave you this small brochure that explains the rules here and
                I will explain some important points ... I understand<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Lottie:</strong> Yes<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Flora mother:</strong> Good, there are three Sabine points for you<br>
                <br>
                <em>First:</em> There is no wandering after midnight, no delay in eating meals, and no bedtime. 
                You will find timings in a booklet.<br>
                <br>
                <em>Second:</em> Also, there are no intimate relationships in the palace, 
                so this is forbidden, because I discovered something..... he was expelled<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Lottie:</strong> Yes, I understand, I have no interest in this<br>
                <br>
                <b>Flora mother:</b> Good, I hope it's not just words<br>
                <br>
                <b>As for third:</b> I warn you...there are no sweets at times,
                 not at times...well, and don't you dare abuse your power as my nanny, Flora.<br>
                 <br>
                 Her eyes were frightening as it didn't seem like an empty warning<br>
                 <br>
                 <b>Lottie:</b> sure sure!!<br>
                 <br>
                 <b>Flora's mother:</b> So you don't have a problem with any of that right?<br>
                 <br>
                 <b>Lottie:</b> Yeah, I don't have a problem with that<br>
                 <br>
                 Lottie noticed her behavior as he seemed to be used to introducing people to the palace and got a strange feeling<br>
                 <br>
                 <b>Flora mother:</b> I noticed that you are not talking a lot, and this is good, but I wonder if it is because of the empty rumors<br>
                 <br>
                 <b>Lottie:</b> Rumors?... No, I don't care about them, but I wonder what rumors are<br>
                 <br>
                 Flora mother was amazed, as she used to ask her about rumors, as she thought that no one knew about her, but look, there is such a person<br>
                 <br>
                 <b>Flora mother laughed:</b> It doesn't matter if you're here, you'll hear about her<br>
                 <br>
                 <b>Lotte asked:</b> Does this mean that I am accepted here, but I did not take any more tests to be eligible<br>
                 <br>
                 <b>Flora mother laughed:</b> We have checked your background and it seems that you like children,
                  not only that, but you are used to raising them like your brother, right?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Lottie was surprised:</b> Check around me<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Flora mother:</b> Yes, does something bother you?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Lottie:</b> No, I'm just surprised you always look at other people's wallpapers<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Flora mother:</b> Not always, but I like your reaction. It's funny
                  <em>Indoor talk 'Lotie':</em> Oh she seems like a more spontaneous woman than I thought<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Flora mother:</b> So shall we go see the guest of honor?<br>
                  <br>
                  She looked happy on Lottie's face, as she really adored children, how much she longed for that child. 
                  It is one of the reasons why she came to work here, even though the house was a bit secluded, 
                  or even if she hadn't even met her, but from my point of view, Lottie, all the children of angels are worth a sacrifice.<br>
                  <br>
                  Then they entered a room that looked like a study room, 
                  and Lottie immediately noticed that a little girl with blond brown hair and beautiful black eyes, 
                  according to me Lottie was a little angel who lacked nothing.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Flora:</b> Welcome to our palace, are you my new nanny?<br>
                  <br>
